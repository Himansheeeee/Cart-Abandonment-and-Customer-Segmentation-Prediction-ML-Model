# Cart-Abandonment-and-Customer-Segmentation-Prediction-ML-Model
Developed a machine learning model to predict cart abandonment using decision trees, enabling proactive interventions to reduce lost sales and improve conversion rates and Built a K-Means clustering model to segment customers based on purchasing behavior, uncovering actionable groups for targeted marketing and retention strategies.



## 🛠️ **Steps Followed**

1. **Problem Definition** – Defined business objectives:

   * Predict cart abandonment to reduce lost sales.
   * Segment customers to enable targeted marketing strategies.

2. **Data Collection & Preparation** –

   * Gathered e-commerce transaction, customer, and product data.
   * Cleaned missing values, handled outliers, and standardized formats.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** –

   * Identified revenue drivers, customer behavior patterns, and cart drop-off points.
   * Visualized correlations between variables (price, discounts, sessions, etc.).

4. **Feature Engineering** –

   * Created new features (cart size, session duration, repeat visits, recency, frequency, monetary value).
   * Encoded categorical data and scaled numerical values.

5. **Model Building** –

   * **Cart Abandonment** → Built classification models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression).
   * **Customer Segmentation** → Applied K-Means clustering to group customers.

6. **Model Evaluation** –

   * Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for cart abandonment.
   * Validated K-Means with silhouette score and cluster interpretability.

7. **Business Insights & Recommendations** –

   * Identified high-risk abandonment customers for proactive offers/reminders.
   * Defined 3–4 customer segments with distinct behaviors for targeted campaigns.

8. **Deployment & Visualization** –

   * Showcased results via dashboards (Power BI/Python plots).
   * Prepared recommendations for marketing and sales teams.
